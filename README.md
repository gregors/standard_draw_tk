# Standard Draw TK 

I was going through the [Algorithms 4th edition](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) and wanted to write the algorithms in ruby instead of the default java. The book uses the [Princeton Standard Libraries](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/) to help clarify the code. I've added a simple [jruby wrapper gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/princeton_standard_libraries) that lets you call the original java code in Jruby. 

I really would like to call this code in standard ruby. So I'm attempting to keep the original interface while recreating the logic using the [ruby TK gem](https://github.com/ruby/tk).

## Installation

Ruby doesn't contain TK by default anymore. And installing the TK gem requires a bit of manual installation depending on the system. I followed this [blog post](https://saveriomiroddi.github.io/Installing-ruby-tk-bindings-gem-on-ubuntu/) to get it working on linux.

## Usage

This is a WIP!!!
